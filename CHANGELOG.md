# Changelog

All notable changes to the `piping-toolset` plugin are recorded here. Dates are UTC.

Labels: **UNCONSERVATIVE-FIX** marks a correction where a previous release could
have produced a result less conservative than the code requires. Installed copies
keep a defect until the plugin is updated, so each such entry names the skill, the
affected inputs and the release that fixed it. GitHub Releases carry the same
label and are the recall channel.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

First public release candidate.

- `load-case-builder`: B31.1/B31.3 static load case sets for CAESAR II and
  AutoPIPE, generated symbolically; QC gate; report extraction matrix.
- `pressure-design`: code-basis interview and B31.3/B31.1 pressure design —
  wall thickness, allowable pressure, branch reinforcement, bends, miters, leak
  test — with bundled scripts that reproduce the pipingtoolset.com calculation
  engine's locked test cases.
- `stress-screening`: sustained, occasional and expansion hand checks, f factor
  by edition, SIF-source resolution, formal-analysis exemption, support spans,
  spring variability.
- No code table values are embedded; every number a skill states comes from a
  script run on inputs the user supplied.
